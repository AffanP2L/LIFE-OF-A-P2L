## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of the LIFE-OF-A-P2L project seriously. While this is primarily a
documentation repository, we want to ensure that any security issues are addressed promptly.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.
2. Send an email to [security@lifeofap2l.org] with:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### Supported Versions

### Security Best Practices

When working with this repository:

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files or expose Firebase credentials
2. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies using `npm audit`
3. **Firebase Security**: Follow Firebase security rules and authentication best practices
4. **Code Review**: Review all changes before merging to prevent security issues

### Common Security Considerations

- **Firebase Configuration**: The `firebaseConfig.js` includes proper error handling and
  validates environment variables to prevent misconfigurations
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits are performed on all dependencies
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- **Access Control**: Proper access controls are implemented for all sensitive operations

### Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Response within 24 hours
- **High-severity vulnerabilities**: Response within 72 hours
